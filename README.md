# WI-FI Channel State Information (CSI) Based-Human Activity Recognition (HAR)

## Introduction
This repository presents a privacy-preserving Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) signals. Our approach leverages LSTM-based architecture to detect and classify activities such as 'idle,' 'walking,' and 'standing' with high accuracy, even in low-light scenarios. This non-vision-based method offers a secure alternative for applications in healthcare, workplace safety, and more.
